# Drag Coefficient for Re=20:  

Calculation of force on the cylinder can be done by implementing a simple control volume approach, by measuring the far-field pressure and velocity at the inlet and outlet as follows. Note all units are non-dimensionalized, and the force is per unit length (of the cylinder).  

By momentum conservation, we have the following, where y is the vertical dimension perpendicular to the cylinder axis and the fluid's general velocity. Note the inlet-outlet notation denotes a pair of integrals for the inlet and outlet, subtracted from each other.  

$$F=\int_{inlet-outlet} p \,dy + \int_{inlet-outlet} \frac{\partial{\vec{p}}}{\partial{t}} $$

$$\implies F=\int_{inlet-outlet} p \,dy + \int_{inlet-outlet} \rho\|{\vec{u}}\|\vec{u}_x \partial{y}$$  

Note this is trivial to calculate, since all the values are non-dimensionalized by OpenFoam.   

The resulting force is 1.358 in units of $\rho U^{2}L$, which becomes a Cd of 2.717.  

Comparing this to results from Tritton (Physical Fluid Dynamics, 1977), and Heddleson et. al. (Summary of Drag Coefficients of Various Shaped Cylinders), we expect a Cd around 2.4 for a Reynolds number of 20, and our result becomes reasonable.
