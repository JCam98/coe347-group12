# Unsteady Flow and Strouhal Number  

We now use the simulations `run_110_3`, `run_110_4`, and `run_110_2` to calculate an approximate Strouhal number: $St=\frac{f}{U/D}={fcn}(Re)$.  

The sole difference between these runs is the blockMeshFactor parameter, which increases block density and decreases timestep.  

Probes were placed at $(x,y)=(5.5,\pm0.5)$, and a Fourier Transform of the nondimensionalized y-velocity was taken with respect to nondimensionalized time, s.t. the highest amplitude resultant frequency is the Strouhal number. Agreement between Strouhal numbers calculated for each probe was verified.

A table of results follows:  

- Mesh  |  St    | timestep 
- 110_3  0.180995  0.000666667;  
- 110_2  0.182648  0.000555556;  
- 110_4  0.181818  0.000444444;  

So clearly the approximations converge to a Strouhal number around 0.182.  

Plots for a probe from each mesh follow, along with the Fourier Transform.

Looking at separation on Mesh 110_2, we see that it occurs at about 117 degrees, as predicted by Park et. al. (Numerical Solutions of Flow Past a Circular Cylinder at Reynolds Numbers up to 160, 1203).
