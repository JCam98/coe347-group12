abstract: A lid-driven cavity is flow-driven to describe stress on and circulation inside buildings and small insect-to-UAV-size aircraft due to open windows or sidewall punctures. The transition between steady & unsteady flow is also roughly bounded, by investigating the Reynolds number at 4 values between 10 to 10^4. A sparse simulation of low-speed and much higher-speed incompressible flows is undertaken, estimating feature shapes at the minimum computational cost.
