# High Reynolds Number - Part 2  

## Window Wall Solution Profiles

Now consider again the profiles along the left and right window walls; the vertical segments along the inside of the window.  
This time we will consider the starting behavior of these profiles at high Re, in particular between T=1 and 2.

### Maximum Strain Rate over Time

TBD

## Cavity Midline Solution Profile

Now again consider the profiles along the vertical midline down the cavity; from the middle of the window down to the back of the cavity.  
Similarly, we will only consider T=1.3.

## Volumetric Flow Rate and Mixing

To investigate inflow/outflow rates, we will consider integration of a profile across the internal window opening (profile D on the mesh diagram).  
Note that the meshFactor of 3 fails for Re=10000 again.

Looking at the net flow rate, clearly the cavity first pressurizes and then slowly depressurizes over time.   
While this is happening, large amounts of fluid are still being cycled through the window - a huge amount in the first few timesteps (up to ~T=2),
and then a somewhat large amount afterwards.  

To visualize the scale, an example will be shown.

For a $1m^2$ window and $90km/hr (56mph)$ wind, approximately $(25m/s)(1)(1)(0.08) = 2m^3 per second$ is cycled through in the first ~2 seconds!  
Afterward, $0.25m^3/s$ is cycled in and out on average.  
After the initial spike, there is a net decreasing outflow starting at $0.05m^3/s$ (using the Re=10000 plot).  
Note this example is fairly realistic, since an EF0 tornado has slightly higher windspeed, and can be approximated as parallel streamline flow due to the large tornado radius.  
While this example is not entirely accurate since the windspeed used can produce much higher Reynolds numbers in flow, the large-scale behavior is identical, as shown below.

Note that the maximum cycle flow rate of 8% freestream is consistent between both Reynolds numbers. From the previous analysis on Strouhal numbers, we see that since the large-scale flows are fairly Reynolds-number-independent, it is possible that the volumetric flowrate has converged, and will remain the same for higher Reynolds numbers.  

If that is the case, then the low-Reynolds analysis can be combined with a couple of measurements of high-Reynolds flow, and extrapolated out to actual cases, providing an extremely useful tool for flow estimation.
