# Motivation  

The flow around an infinite, circular cylinder is a well-studied, but yet not completely understood problem in CFD (computational fluid dynamics). A simple exploration of the steady and unsteady flow at low Reynolds numbers is undertaken here, to provide a light overview of the problem.
